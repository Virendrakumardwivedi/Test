how i can encounter this data into our java applicaton.

         folder src in the application.
 using an HashMap we can easily convert our data into the desired result.

here key is the alphabetical value and and "value" is the numerical numbers
for ex:- A1 - key
         5  - value
         =4+5 - treat as value
